In 1997, the historic chess match between Gary Kasparov, the reigning world chess champion, and IBM's Deep Blue took place. This event marked a pivotal moment in the history of chess and artificial intelligence. Deep Blue, developed by IBM, was one of the earliest computer systems designed to play chess at a high level.


The match consisted of a pair of six-game chess matches held in New York City. Deep Blue made history by defeating Kasparov in the decisive sixth game, with a final score of 3½–2½ in favor of the computer. This was a significant milestone as it marked the first time a reigning world chess champion had been defeated by a computer in a classical chess match.


The victory of Deep Blue over Kasparov had a profound impact on the world of chess and AI. It demonstrated the potential of computers to challenge and even surpass human expertise in complex games. This event paved the way for further advancements in AI and its applications beyond chess, showcasing the growing capabilities of artificial intelligence systems.
