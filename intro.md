you've probably read in the news that deep learning is the secret recipe behind many exciting developments and
has made many of our world's dreams and perhaps also nightmares come true

who would have thought that deep minds alphago could beat lee sedol in a boat game which boasts in more possible
moves than there are atoms in the entire universe

a lot of people including me never saw it coming it seemed impossible but it's here now deep learning is everywhere
it's beating physicians, are diagnosing cancer, it's responsible for translating web pages in a matter of mere seconds to
the autonomous vehicles by weimo and tesla

how to build remarkable algorithms capable of solving complex problems that weren't possible just a few decades ago 

we'll talk about what deep learning is and the difference between artificial
intelligence and machine learning i'll introduce neural networks what they are and just how essential they are to deep
learning you're going to learn about how deep learning models train and learn and the various types of learning associated supervised unsupervised and reinforcement learning 

we're going to talk about loss functions, optimizers, the grading descent algorithm the different
types of neural network architectures and the various steps involved in deep learning


but deep learning can do more than just betas at boat games it finds applications anywhere from self-driving
vehicles to fake news detection to even predicting earthquakes these were astonishing moments not only
because machines beat humans at their own games but because of the endless possibilities that they opened up

what followed such events have been a series of striking breakthroughs in artificial intelligence machine learning
and yes deep learning
